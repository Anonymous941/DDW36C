COMMAND:  open

USAGE:  open  bootloader|image1|image2|perm|dyn|bdyn

DESCRIPTION:
Opens the flash driver for use by the console (locking out the rest of the 
application!) so that you can use the read/write/erase commands.  NOTE:  If 
you do something that would cause the driver to be opened again (write 
nonvol, dload an image, etc), then the operation will be blocked until you 
run the close command, or it may fail.

EXAMPLES:
open image2  -- Opens the image2 region for read/write/erase
